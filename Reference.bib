Techniques for preventing the attack for RSA and Diffie-Hellman are presented. Some cryptosystems will need to be revised to protect against the attack, and new protocols and algorithms may need to incorporate measures to prevent timing attacks.",

Recent work has shown that side channel attacks pose a serious threat to cryptosystems implemented in embedded devices. In this paper, we develop theoretical foundations for security against side channels. In particular, we propose several efficient techniques for building private circuits resisting this type of attacks. We initiate a systematic study of the complexity of such private circuits, and in contrast to most prior work in this area provide a formal threat model and give proofs of security for our constructions.",

This setting of auxiliary input is more general than the more traditional setting, which assumes that some of information about the secret key sk may be leaked, but sk still has high min-entropy left. In particular, we deal with situations where f(sk) information-theoretically determines the entire secret key sk.As our main result, we construct CPA/CCA secure symmetric encryption schemes that remain secure with exponentially hard-to-invert auxiliary input. We give several applications of such schemes. * We construct an average-case obfuscator for the class of point functions, which remains secure with exponentially hard-to-invert auxiliary input, and is reusable. * We construct a reusable and robust extractor that remains secure with exponentially hard-to-invert auxiliary input.

%abstract = { A fundamental fact about polynomial interpolation is that k evaluations of a degree-(k-1) polynomial f are sufficient to determine f. This is also necessary in a strong sense: given k-1 evaluations, we learn nothing about the value of f on any k'th point. In this paper, we study a variant of the polynomial interpolation problem. Instead of querying entire evaluations of f (which are elements of a large field F), we are allowed to query partial evaluations; that is, each evaluation delivers a few elements from a small subfield of F, rather than a single element from F. We show that in this model, one can do significantly better than in the traditional setting, in terms of the amount of information required to determine the missing evaluation. More precisely, we show that only O(k) bits are necessary to recover a missing evaluation. In contrast, the traditional method of looking at k evaluations requires Omega(k log(k)) bits. We also show that our result is optimal for linear methods, even up to the leading constants. Our motivation comes from the use of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes for distributed storage systems, in particular for the exact repair problem. The traditional use of RS codes in this setting is analogous to the traditional interpolation problem. Each node in a system stores an evaluation of f, and if one node fails we can recover it by reading k other nodes. However, each node is free to send less information, leading to the modified problem above. The quickly-developing field of regenerating codes has yielded several codes which take advantage of this freedom. However, these codes are not RS codes, and RS codes are still often used in practice; in 2011, Dimakis et al. asked how well RS codes could perform in this setting. Our results imply that RS codes can also take advantage of this freedom to download partial symbols. In some parameter regimes---those with small levels of sub-packetization---our scheme for RS codes outperforms all known regenerating codes. Even with a high degree of sub-packetization, our methods give non-trivial schemes, and we give an improved repair scheme for a specific (14,10)-RS code used in the Facebook Hadoop Analytics cluster. },

%abstract = {A number of works have focused on the setting where an adversary tampers with the shares of a secret sharing scheme. This includes literature on verifiable secret sharing, algebraic manipulation detection(AMD) codes, and, error correcting or detecting codes in general. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of what we call non-malleable secret sharing. Very roughly, the guarantee we seek is the following: the adversary may potentially tamper with all of the shares, and still, either the reconstruction procedure outputs the original secret, or, the original secret is “destroyed” and the reconstruction outputs a string which is completely “unrelated” to the original secret. Recent exciting work on non-malleable codes in the split-state model led to constructions which can be seen as 2-out-of-2 non-malleable secret sharing schemes. These constructions have already found a number of applications in cryptography. We investigate the natural question of constructing t-out-of-n non-malleable secret sharing schemes. Such a secret sharing scheme ensures that only a set consisting of t or more shares can reconstruct the secret, and, additionally guarantees non-malleability under an attack where potentially every share maybe tampered with. Techniques used for obtaining split-state non-malleable codes (or 2-out-of-2 non-malleable secret sharing) are (in some form) based on two-source extractors and seem not to generalize to our setting. Our first result is the construction of a t-out-of-n non-malleable secret sharing scheme against an adversary who arbitrarily tampers each of the shares independently. Our construction is unconditional and features statistical non-malleability. As our main technical result, we present t-out-of-n non-malleable secret sharing scheme in a stronger adversarial model where an adversary may jointly tamper multiple shares. Our construction is unconditional and the adversary is allowed to jointly-tamper subsets of up to (t−1) shares. We believe that the techniques introduced in our construction may be of independent interest. Inspired by the well studied problem of perfectly secure message transmission introduced in the seminal work of Dolev et. al (J. of ACM’93), we also initiate the study of non-malleable message transmission. Non-malleable message transmission can be seen as a natural generalization in which the goal is to ensure that the receiver either receives the original message, or, the original message is essentially destroyed and the receiver receives an “unrelated” message, when the network is under the influence of an adversary who can byzantinely corrupt all the nodes in the network. As natural applications of our non-malleable secret sharing schemes, we propose constructions for non-malleable message transmission.},

A leakage-resilient secret sharing scheme hides the secret from an adversary, who has access to an unqualified set of shares, even if the adversary additionally obtains some size-bounded leakage from all other secret shares. A non-malleable secret sharing scheme guarantees that a secret that is reconstructed from a set of tampered shares is either equal to the original secret or completely unrelated. To the best of our knowledge we present the first generic compiler for leakage-resilient secret sharing for general access structures. In the case of non-malleable secret sharing, we strengthen previous definitions, provide separations between them, and construct a non-malleable secret sharing scheme for general access structures that fulfills the strongest definition with respect to independent share tampering functions. More precisely, our scheme is secure against concurrent tampering: The adversary is allowed to (non-adaptively) tamper the shares multiple times, and in each tampering attempt can freely choose the qualified set of shares to be used by the reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct the tampered secret. This is a strong analogue of the multiple-tampering setting for split-state non-malleable codes and extractors.",
